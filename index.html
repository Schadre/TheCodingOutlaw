    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Meet The Outlaw</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Schadrè Dent, and I am studying to be an awesome outlaw and software engineer. I am currently moving to Houston, Texas where I hope to own a farm soon and build my own environment powered by renewable energy. I have worked in manufacturing for a few years now and I am at a pivot point in my career path, so I have been doing my research on the computer and technical science industry from data analytics to cybersecurity to software engineering. I previously went to college to study business and accounting, so this is a very different and, even more so, exciting endeavor I’m on. </p>
    <p>I would like to become a web developer because it seems like an exciting and fun career path that could challegne me, and I literally want ot learn everything I can.</p>
    <p>I spend most of my free time either resting, going on hikes and enjoying nature, researching anything that I find to be interesting and/or informative, and watching and/or reading anime manga. I love the dramatics in the story language behind anime shows and in the expressions. It is almost as if the artists accurately give us human emotion in cartoon format. Some of my favorite anime would be ‘Seven Deadly Sins’, ‘Hunter X Hunter, and ‘Demon Slayer’ to name a very short few. I enjoy learning about different cultures and religions and what life means. I am writing my own manga and it is more invigorating than I anticipated. </p>
